# AIVFR - AI Assisted Flight Planning Webtool
AIVFR is an experimental AI assisted flight planning webtool for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) pilots in the UK. It gives users the ability to create routes, see weather reports, create and download flight breifings that include Threat and Error Management, pilot logs, and also configure fuel and mass & balance details. Created by a licensed UK pilot (PPL level at the time of publishing), this project had the aim of seeing how AI can be integrated into real-world VFR flight planning solutions in the future, as currently they often dominate (and rightfully so) in the more complex, commercial operations.

Fun fact: The very first version of this tool was made as part of the OCR Computer Science A-level Non-Exam Assessment, and is the most ambitious project I had ever done, and was fundamental in my journey of learning web-design and structured coding in general!
