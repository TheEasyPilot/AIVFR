DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA (TO BE DELETED AFTER)

Iteration 1
Screenshot/code
Explanation and justification of code.
Evidence of you testing your code. (Screenshots or a video).
Did you encounter any errors?
If no, move on to the next part if you did not add anything to the code.
If yes, show the error.
Explain and justify how you fixed it.
Then show iteration 2.
Iteration 2:
Same as above. 
There is no need for iteration 2 if iteration 1 was enough.


Section review:
At the end of the section include a review.

—
Provided evidence of each stage of the iterative development process for a coded solution relating this to the break down of the problem from the analysis stage
 and explaining what they did and justifying why.
 • Provided evidence of prototype versions of their solution for each stage of the process.
 • The solution will be well structured and modular in nature. 
• Code will be annotated to aid future maintenance of the system. 
• All variables and structures will be appropriately named. 
• There will be evidence of validation for all key elements of the solution.
 • The development will show review at all key stages in the process.

Testing to inform development

• Provided evidence of testing at each stage of the iterative development process.
 • Provided evidence of any failed tests and the remedial actions taken with full justification for any actions taken.
